# Investment Portfolio Simulator

A modern web application for simulating and tracking investment portfolios with real-time data. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Why this Project?
- I wanted to see how my portfolio would perform if I had invested in something else, and thus with savings plan(s)
- The main issue with other saving-plan calculators is, that they calculate based on the p.a. performance, i wanted further insights however, and thus this projected was created.
- It allows you to see how single-investments and savings plans would have performed, and how they would have affected your portfolio.
- There are multiple indicators and design choices made:
  - TTWOR (Time Travel Without Risk) calculations
  - Average Portfolio Performance
  - Portfolio Performance & Value
  - All assets (except the TTWOR and Portfolio-Value) are scaled by percentage of their price. Thus their referenced, scale is on the right. The referenced scale on the left is only for the portfolio-value
